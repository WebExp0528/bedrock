## Techincal information

There are some major libs we use:

### [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Type errors are found within compile time - it's beautiful.

### [React](https://reactjs.org/)

React. We are also using [react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html). All the components are functional components (except the ones that should be inherited from lib's class components, like nextjs root "App" component).

### [Next](https://nextjs.org/)

You should definitely read the docs about it, if you not familiar with this. Two main things you need to know:

* There are no "routes" - the routes are generated by next, depending on ["pages"](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/tree/master/src/pages) folder structure (but dynamic routes are also doable - read [this](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-dynamic-pages) and [that](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/clean-urls-with-route-masking)). We call these special components "Page Component".

* Page components have `getInitialProps` which is used to make requests, to get initial data ([See docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/fetching-data-for-pages), [See project examples](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/search?q=getInitialProps))

### [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)

That's it, Electron. It's a desktop app.

### [react-request-hook](https://github.com/schettino/react-request-hook)

I've mentioned we're using react hooks. Basic hooks come with React. But this custom one lets you make requests in a beautiful way. It also has a great typescript integration, see the hints:
