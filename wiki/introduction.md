## Techincal information

There are some major libs we use:

### [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Type errors are found within compile time - it's beautiful.

### [React](https://reactjs.org/)

React. We are also using [react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html). All the components are functional components (except the ones that should be inherited from lib's class components, like nextjs root "App" component).

### [Next](https://nextjs.org/)

You should definitely read the docs about it, if you not familiar with this. Two main things you need to know:

* There are no "routes" - the routes are generated by next, depending on ["pages"](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/tree/master/src/pages) folder structure (but dynamic routes are also doable - read [this](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-dynamic-pages) and [that](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/clean-urls-with-route-masking)). We call these special components "Page Component".

* Page components have `getInitialProps` which is used to make requests, to get initial data ([See docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/fetching-data-for-pages), [See project examples](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/search?q=getInitialProps))

### [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)

That's it, Electron. It's a desktop app.

### [react-request-hook](https://github.com/schettino/react-request-hook)

I've mentioned we're using react hooks. Basic hooks come with React. But this custom one lets you make requests in a beautiful way. It also has a great typescript integration, see the hints:

## Development cycle

All the development is happening here, in github. If you find some bugs or places in code to improve - please, don't hesitate, [file new issues](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/issues/new).

Of course, if you need any help, you can contact me, Jerry Green - https://t.me/jerrygreen, but if questions are related to an issue - let's keep the conversation in the issue.

Also, since you're reading this introduction, you are new to the project. Please, start with this type of issues:

* [`good first issue`](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

So the overall cycle is this:

1. [You take an issue](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Aprometheonsystems%2Fbedrock-client2%2F1), assign to yourself (note, it's not any issue - only these that are [in the project](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/projects/1))
2. You create a branch named like `@yourgithubnickname/any-text-you-wish`, for example - `@jerrygreen/data-inbox`
3. You code, make commits, push it
4. You [make a Pull Request](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/compare) for your branch to be merged in master
5. We discuss it, fix it, untill it's merged

In Pull Request, please, note the issues you are fixing, in the description. Make descriptions like this (or, more detailed):

```
A lot of core functionality

Closes #11 
```

You'll get something like this:

You may specify several issues per PR. As soon as your PR will be merged, the issues will be automatically closed.
