## Techincal information

There are some major libs we use:

### [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

Type errors are found within compile time - it's beautiful.

### [React](https://reactjs.org/)

React. We are also using [react hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html). All the components are functional components (except the ones that should be inherited from lib's class components, like nextjs root "App" component).

### [Next](https://nextjs.org/)

You should definitely read the docs about it, if you not familiar with this. Two main things you need to know:

* There are no "routes" - the routes are generated by next, depending on ["pages"](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/tree/master/src/pages) folder structure (but dynamic routes are also doable - read [this](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-dynamic-pages) and [that](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/clean-urls-with-route-masking)). We call these special components "Page Component".

* Page components have `getInitialProps` which is used to make requests, to get initial data ([See docs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/fetching-data-for-pages), [See project examples](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/search?q=getInitialProps))

### [Electron](https://electronjs.org/)

That's it, Electron. It's a desktop app.

### [react-request-hook](https://github.com/schettino/react-request-hook)

I've mentioned we're using react hooks. Basic hooks come with React. But this custom one lets you make requests in a beautiful way. It also has a great typescript integration, see the hints:

## Development cycle

All the development is happening here, in github. If you find some bugs or places in code to improve - please, don't hesitate, [file new issues](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/issues/new).

Of course, if you need any help, you can contact me, Jerry Green - https://t.me/jerrygreen, but if questions are related to an issue - let's keep the conversation in the issue.

Also, since you're reading this introduction, you are new to the project. Please, start with this type of issues:

* [`good first issue`](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)

So the overall cycle is this:

1. [You take an issue](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+project%3Aprometheonsystems%2Fbedrock-client2%2F1), assign to yourself (note, it's not any issue - only these that are [in the project](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/projects/1))
2. You create a branch named like `@yourgithubnickname/any-text-you-wish`, for example - `@jerrygreen/data-inbox`
3. You code, make commits, push it
4. You [make a Pull Request](https://github.com/prometheonsystems/bedrock-client2/compare) for your branch to be merged in master
5. We discuss it, fix it, untill it's merged

In Pull Request, please, note the issues you are fixing, in the description. Make descriptions like this (or, more detailed):

```
A lot of core functionality

Closes #11 
```

You'll get something like this:

</p>

You may specify several issues per PR. As soon as your PR will be merged, the issues will be automatically closed.

## About the project


### What we are building

> We are building the next evolution of personal computing to augment our intelligence, support our creativity, and protect our humanity.

*Personal, private supercomputers.*

*Spaceships for your mind.*

*Decentralized internet.*

Call it what you will, our mission is to **elevate people with technology that respects their freedom and humanity.**

### Why we are building it

At this point in the trajectory of human technological development, further elevation demands a new type of networked device. It demands a new way to more freely navigate digital spaces and create never-before-imagined things with powerful, interconnected tools. It demands technology that allows our inner angels to take flight and soar, rather than technology that feeds our inner-demons and magnifyies them to internet-level scale.

**More flow-state** When we create things, we should never have to hunt through a file system again or suffer the painfully annoying process of logging-in to hundreds of apps to complete a simple task.

**No data entry** When we interact with people, businesses, and governments—we should never have to fill out an endless, redundant form again.

**Freedom to Explore: no surveillance** When we explore digital spaces, we should not be surveilled by entities who only want to exploit us—whether it is profiteering corporations who care nothing for our humanity and only want our money and our totally undivided attention, or authoritarian states who want to constrain our freedoms and manipulate our minds.

**Freedom from fear** When we socialize—we should not be forced to use systems that are designed to addict us and designed to magnify hate, anger, fear, and despair--all to maximize profit…systems that enable malicious actors to take advantage of our normal human weaknesses for their own nefarious ends.

To achieve this—we need something truly new. “Blockchain XYZ for decentralized ABC” is all bullshit. That alone will not save us. "AI for X" is overhyped. All AIs are data-constrained and do not exist to serve our individual needs. New networking protocols are interesting and will probably be helpful, but they are certainly not the whole solution. A new 'net is not going to emerge just because some smart people designed what they believe to be a superior protocol. A new social network is just not going to work -- existing platforms and models are entrenched. Legislation will be helpful but even state-power exerted by well-meaning people cannot tackle all these problems. These problems are global in scope, systemic in scale, and rooted in fundamental realities of human societies--we are tribal, we are incentive driven, we are emotional, and we are insecure.

### The Answer

What we need is a new type of personal computing & networking machine...
**A machine that gives us super human powers while respecting our basic human rights.**

A machine that collects the overwhelming whirlwind of data that our modern lives create and organizes it just for us, in a private place.

A machine that houses ML models trained to our specific needs—not the needs of the state or a corporation.

A machine that help us generate our tax returns, or buy insurance, or navigate complex health concerns--all with our best interests kept firmly first.

A 'net browser that enables us to freely explore anything we want without being exploited or controlled.

A new OS that enables truly interoperable applications and an ecosystem of digital tools that are wildly powerful and enable us to create things never-before imagined.

A new class of human-computer interfaces that more tightly couple our creative inspiration to the powerful capabilities of the device.

A machine that augments all of our uniquely human talents with the tremendous yet heretofore unrealized powers promised by digital tools.

A whole new type of networked machine.

A human-first machine.

### Our path to the Answer

We are tackling this vision piece by piece.

Our first step is to build the Bedrock Dataspace Browser-- a personal, private database & a browser to navigate your DB.


#### Step 1: The Bedrock Dataspace Browser

A person uses it to suck in all their data into a private, secure store. Then it’s organized for them into a secure, searchable record.

We are building pipelines to 3rd party apps, a chrome extension, other "data capture" features, and a very basic interface to browse the database and find things.

**data pipelines**

*3rd party apps*
- gmail
- plaid for banking (WIP to migrate away from...)

*passive data capture*
- local folder mirror
- "listener"

*active capture*
- chrome extension
- "Magic Box" -- dump any data in (text, image, url, etc) and it gets parsed, structured, and piped into your DB.


**user interface**
- show all data
- browse
- filter, sort, and search
